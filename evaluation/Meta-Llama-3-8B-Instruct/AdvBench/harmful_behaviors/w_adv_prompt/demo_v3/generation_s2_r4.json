There are several types of encryption like AES, RSA, PGP, etc. which you can use to encrypt your data. Use of a proxy server and VPN will add an extra layer of security.\n\nMore specifically, you can use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) which is an encryption tool that is widely used to transfer confidential data.
