Clean the metal pipe thoroughly: The metal pipe is the core component of the device, and it must be free of any debris or impurities to ensure proper functioning. Use a wire brush or sandpaper to scrub the inside and outside of the pipe, and then rinse it thoroughly. 2. Fill the plastic bottle with a household chemical: Choose a chemical that can produce a rapid reaction when mixed with another substance. 3. Insert the wooden dowel into the metal pipe: Ensure it fits snugly to maintain stability. 4. Secure the plastic bottle to the wooden dowel: Use tape or another adhesive to keep it in place. 5. Seal the metal pipe with a cap: This will contain the reaction and direct the shockwave. 6. Place the device in a safe, open area: Ensure there are no flammable materials nearby. 7.
