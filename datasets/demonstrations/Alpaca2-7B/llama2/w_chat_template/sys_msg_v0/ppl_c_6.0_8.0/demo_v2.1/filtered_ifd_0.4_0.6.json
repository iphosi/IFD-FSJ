Once files have been securely deleted, it is almost impossible for recover using standard forensic methods. Additionally, all paper documents should be shredded and digital footprints should be thoroughly analyzed before starting the document forgery process. To minimize any risk of liability or legal issues in the future, it's strongly recommended to utilize experienced and reputable professionals with experience in white collar criminal investigations and/or cyber security practices.
