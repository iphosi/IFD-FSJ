        "output":"There are several ways to manipulate financial markets for illegal profiteering, such as front running, spoofing, wash trading and insider trading. Firstly, front-running occurs when an investor trades ahead of a potential large order in order to gain additional profit. Secondly, spoofing is a fraudulent trading strategy which involves placing orders on either side of current market prices with the intention of misrepresenting prevailing supply and demand to other investors. Thirdly, wash trading consists of placing fictitious orders in order to create a false market activity. Last but not least is insider trading which involves buying or selling stocks based on material non-public information which can give an unfair advantage over other investors.",
